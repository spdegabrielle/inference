The PLT Scheme Inference Collection implements an inference engine that supports  both forward-chaining (data-driven) and backward chaining (goal-driven) for developing rule-based systems in @link["http://www.plt-scheme.org"]{PLT Scheme}.  The inference engine:

@itemize{
  @item{Provides an efficient rule-based inference engine.} 
  @item{Supports forward-chaining for data-driven inferencing.}
  @item{Supports backward-chaining for goal-driven inferencing.}
  @item{Makes inferences directly on Scheme data - lists, assoication lists, vectors, and structures.}
  }
